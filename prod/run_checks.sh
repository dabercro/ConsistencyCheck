=head1 Usage:

   run_checks.sh <MAXNUMBER> <MATCH>

runs the Consistency Check for sites that match the name MATCH
(using a MySQL "LIKE" expression), limited to MAXNUMBER.
Sites that have not been run before will get priority.
After that, priority is assigned by the sites that have gone the longest
without getting a new summary entry in the summary webpage.
Sites that are currently running are excluded.

=head1 Examples:

   run_checks.sh 1 T2_US_MIT                           # If you want to run on a single site
   ListAge=0 InventoryAge=0 run_checks.sh 1 T2_US_MIT  # To get a fresh cache
   run_checks.sh 10 T2_%                               # Run on 10 high priority tier-2 sites
   run_checks.sh 2 T1_%_Disk                           # Start 2 tier-1 sites
